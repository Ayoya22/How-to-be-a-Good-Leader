# How To Be A Good Leader
Below I will enumarate 10 points very briefly of how a leader should be and the things that need to be done by a good leader. However if you lack some of these points this does not make you a bad leader, but you need
to always have an introspection of yourself and ameliorate yourself

### 1. Honesty and Integrity
`The supreme quality of leadership is unquestionably integrity`. Without it, no real success is possible, 
no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.‚Äù 
Honesty and integrity are two important ingredients which make a good leader. 
How can you expect your team members to be honest when you lack these qualities yourself?
Leaders succeed when they stick to their values and core beliefs and without ethics, this will not be possible.
