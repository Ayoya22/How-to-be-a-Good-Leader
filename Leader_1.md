# How To Be A Good Leader
Below I will enumarate 10 points very briefly of how a leader should be and the things that need to be done by a good leader. However if you lack some of these points this does not make you a bad leader, but you need
to always have an introspection of yourself and ameliorate yourself

### 1. Honesty and Integrity
`The supreme quality of leadership is unquestionably integrity`. Without it, no real success is possible, 
no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.‚Äù 
Honesty and integrity are two important ingredients which make a good leader. 
How can you expect your team members to be honest when you lack these qualities yourself?
Leaders succeed when they stick to their values and core beliefs and without ethics, this will not be possible.

### 2. Be technically proficient
Being an effective leader also means you need to stay one step ahead of your team when it comes to project implementations that are related to the company or personal work. A good leader will need to have a masterey of the work he/she is leading and will be able to better lead the team. He need to go extra miles in the work thst he is assigned to.

### 3. Get to know your team
Management dictates that you have a degree of separation from your team. You should always bear in mind that your team will be made up of individuals who have different outlooks and abilities and will be at different stages of their careers. Therefore it is vital to understand what makes them tick and to remember that what motivates one, won't necessarily motivate another.

### 4. Good Communicator
Until you clearly communicate your vision to your team and tell them the strategy to achieve the goal, it will be very difficult for you to get the results you want. Simply put, if you are unable to communicate your message effectively to your team, you can never be a good leader. A good communicator can be a good leader. Words have the power to motivate people and make them do the unthinkable. If you use them effectively, you can also achieve better results.
